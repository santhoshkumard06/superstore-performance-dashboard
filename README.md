# Superstore Performance Dashboard — Power BI Business Dashboard

A 2 page Business Intelligence dashboard built on the Superstore Sales dataset, designed to surface a **revenue vs profitability paradox** hiding inside four years of retail transactions and to pinpoint exactly which products, regions, and discount tiers are responsible.

## 🔧 How Every Visual Maps to Power BI (Build Guide)

This dashboard uses **only features that exist natively in Power BI Desktop** no element here requires a custom visual or external tool. The "gradient" effects come from Power BI's real **conditional formatting color scales**, not decorative styling.

| Visual | Power BI Feature |
|---|---|
| KPI cards | **Card** visual + custom theme accent colors; rounded corners & shadow via *Format visual → Effects* |
| Page background | Full-page **rectangle Shape** with 2-color **gradient fill**, sent to back |
| Revenue by Region / Category Mix donut / Margin by Category | **Clustered column** / **Donut** charts using **Data colors** — one solid color per category (standard custom theme) |
| Monthly Sales Trend | **Line chart** with **Area** fill at reduced transparency |
| Profit by Sub-Category | **Bar chart**, *Format visual → Data colors → Format by: **Color scale (Diverging)*** — Minimum = coral, Center = slate, Maximum = teal |
| The Discount Cliff | Same **Diverging color scale**, applied to a bar chart of *Profit Margin %* by *Discount Tier* |
| Top 10 Products | **Bar chart**, *Color scale (Sequential)* — Minimum = light indigo, Maximum = deep indigo |
| Overview / Products tab nav | **Bookmarks + Buttons** (standard custom-navigation pattern) |
| Year / Region filters | **Slicer** visual, "Tile" layout style |

Every number is also independently verified against the raw 9,994-row dataset — see the business story below.

## 🔍 The Business Story

> **Revenue grew +20.4% year over year (FY2016 → FY2017), but profit margin slipped from 13.4% to 12.7% and the entire decline traces back to one category and one pricing lever: discounting on Furniture.**

The data tells a layered story:

**1. Furniture is the only category dragging down profitability.**
Technology (17.4% margin) and Office Supplies (17.0% margin) both comfortably beat the 12.5% company average. Furniture sits at just **2.5%** on $742K of revenue, nearly a third of total sales, it contributes almost nothing to the bottom line.

**2. Two sub categories are outright loss makers.**
*Tables* lost **−$17,725** and *Bookcases* lost **−$3,473** over the four year period the only two negative sub categories out of 17. Every other sub category, including the rest of Furniture (Chairs +$26,590, Furnishings +$13,059), is profitable.

**3. The root cause is discounting, and it has a hard cliff.**
Across *all* categories and regions, profit margin behaves predictably by discount tier:

| Discount Tier | Profit Margin | Orders |
|---|---|---|
| 0% | **+29.5%** | 4,798 |
| 1–10% | +16.6% | 94 |
| 11–20% | +11.6% | 3,709 |
| 21–30% | **−10.0%** | 227 |
| 31–50% | −24.8% | 310 |
| 51%+ | **−119.2%** | 856 |

The moment a discount crosses **20%**, every order becomes a loss. **1,393 orders (13.9% of all transactions)** fall into this loss making zone.

**4. Tables in the East region is the single worst performing segment in the dataset.**
East region Tables carry an average discount of **37.4%** and post a **−28.2% margin**, losing **−$11,025** the single largest loss concentration anywhere in the business. By contrast, West region Tables (20% avg. discount) are *slightly profitable* (+1.75%), proving the product itself isn't the problem the **discount policy** is.

## 💡 The Recommendation

This dashboard doesn't just report numbers it points at a lever:

> **Cap discounts on Tables and Bookcases at ≤20%, with the East region prioritized first.** Based on FY2017 volumes, bringing East-region Tables back to a 20% discount, break even position alone would recover roughly **$11K** in annual profit and the same discipline applied company wide across the 21%+ discount tiers (which currently produce −$135K in combined losses against $362K of revenue) represents the single largest margin recovery opportunity in the business.

## 🛠️ How This Was Built

- **Data source:** `Sample - Superstore.xlsx` (same dataset used in Project 1 Excel Dashboard)
- **Metrics verified directly against the source data** every KPI, chart value, and percentage in this README and dashboard was computed from the raw 9,994 row dataset (no placeholder/estimated figures)
- **Design system:** dark custom Power BI theme solid categorical accent colors (indigo, teal, amber, purple, coral) defined via theme JSON; Inter/Segoe UI typography
- **Slicers:** Year (Page 1) and Region (Page 2), matching standard Power BI cross-filtering UX
